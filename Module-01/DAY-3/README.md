## AIM:
To develop a java Program to print the value if it is greater than 10 using class and methods

## ALGORITHM :
```
1.Start the program
2.Create a class named CheckValue with a method called checkNumber(int num).
3Inside checkNumber method, check if the number is greater than 10.
4.If true, print the number.
5.If false, do not print anything or print a message (optional).
6.In another class (e.g., Main), create the main() method.
7.Inside main(), take input from the user using Scanner.
8.End the program
```

## PROGRAM:
 ```
/*
Program to implement a class & objects using Java

```

## Sourcecode.java:

```
 public void check(int num) {
        if (num > 10) {
            System.out.println(num);
        } else {
            System.out.println("invalid");
        }
